K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into a predetermined number of clusters. It is widely used in various fields such as data mining, image processing, and pattern recognition.

Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Initialization: Select k initial centroids randomly from the dataset. These centroids represent the initial cluster centers.

2. Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming k clusters.

3. Update Centroids: Recalculate the centroid of each cluster by taking the mean of all data points assigned to that cluster.

4. Repeat: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence, i.e., until the centroids no longer change significantly or until a specified number of iterations is reached.

5. Convergence: The algorithm converges when the centroids stabilize, and the assignments of data points to clusters remain unchanged.

K-means clustering aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), which measures the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned centroid. The algorithm optimizes this objective function by iteratively updating cluster assignments and centroids.

However, K-means clustering has some limitations. It requires the number of clusters (k) to be specified beforehand, which can be a drawback if the optimal number of clusters is not known in advance. Also, the algorithm may converge to a local optimum, depending on the initial selection of centroids. Therefore, multiple initializations with different starting centroids are often used to mitigate this issue.

Despite its limitations, K-means clustering is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets effectively, making it a popular choice for many clustering tasks.
